# 🚀 Streamlit Deployment Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you deploy your ASRS Runway Incursion Dashboard as a single Streamlit application to **Streamlit Community Cloud** for free.

## ✅ What's Been Converted

### **Dependencies**: `requirements_streamlit.txt`
- All Python packages needed for deployment
- Lightweight and optimized for Streamlit Cloud

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Prepare Your Repository**
```bash
# Ensure these files are in your repo:
# - streamlit_app.py (main application)
# - requirements_streamlit.txt (dependencies)
# - Jan1990_Jan2025.csv (data file)
# - preprocessing_helpers.py (your existing helper)
# - visual_helpers.py (your existing helper)
# - nlp_visuals/ (directory with HTML files)
```

# Run the app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Streamlit app** using the steps above
2. **Test all functionality** on the deployed version
3. **Share the URL** with your users
4. **Consider retiring** the old multi-service architecture

This single Streamlit app will be much more reliable and easier to maintain than your current setup!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
- Check that all required files are in your repository
- Verify `requirements_streamlit.txt` has all dependencies
- Ensure CSV data file is included (not too large for GitHub)
- Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific error messages

**For large data files:**
- Consider using Git LFS for files > 100MB
- Or upload to cloud storage and modify the loading function
